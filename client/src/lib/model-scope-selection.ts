// Pure logic behind the post-add model picker on the Keys page.
//
// A freshly pasted provider key serves EVERY model of its platform (#657:
// `model_scope_json` NULL = no scope). That is right for most people and wrong
// for anyone holding a relay-station key that only pays for a couple of model
// groups — and the only way to find out used to be a stream of 401s at routing
// time. So the moment a key lands for a platform with a big catalog, offer the
// list once.
//
// The two rules that make the offer safe to accept:
//   * "everything ticked" must stay a NULL scope, never the full id list.
//     A stored list freezes the key at today's catalog, so every model the
//     catalog gains next month would silently bypass that key.
//   * "nothing ticked" is not a scope. The server maps an empty array back to
//     NULL (= serves everything), which is the exact opposite of what an empty
//     tick list looks like it means, so the caller must refuse to submit it
//     rather than send a request that quietly does the wrong thing.
//
// Kept out of the component so both rules are unit-testable without rendering.
