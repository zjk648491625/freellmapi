## Chat completions

**Python**

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:3001/v1",
    api_key="freellmapi-your-unified-key",
)

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto",  # let the router pick; or specify e.g. "gemini-2.5-flash"
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Summarise the fall of Rome in one sentence."}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
print("Routed via:", resp.headers.get("x-routed-via"))
```

**curl**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer freellmapi-your-unified-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]
  }'
```

## Routing strategies (`auto:*`)

Plain `auto` follows your active fallback chain. Add a suffix to steer a single request instead — no dashboard changes needed:

- `auto:smart` — favor the highest-intelligence models
- `auto:fast` — favor measured speed (throughput and time-to-first-byte)
- `auto:cheap` — budget-leaning; currently the same blend as `balanced` (everything in the pool is already free)
- `auto:reliable` — favor recent success rate
- `auto:balanced` — the default blend (reliability first, speed and intelligence split the rest)

These rank **every enabled model**, ignoring your chain order. Common synonyms resolve too (`auto:fastest`, `auto:speed`, `auto:smartest`, `auto:cheapest`, `auto:budget`, …), and the whole model string is case-insensitive.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer freellmapi-your-unified-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto:fast",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]
  }'
```

`auto:<profile-name>` routes through a named profile's chain instead of the active one, so different tools can use different chains through the same key:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer freellmapi-your-unified-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto:coding",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a binary search in Rust."}]
  }'
```

An unknown profile name returns a clear `400` rather than silently falling back. Profiles are named fallback chains (see [Features](../../../README.md#features)) — create and switch them from the dashboard; whichever is active is what plain `auto` uses.

## Model listing

`GET /v1/models` lists the whole catalog, including models you cannot call yet, so a client can show what exists as well as what is connected. `?available=true` (aliases `?connected=true`, `?ready=true`) narrows to models that can serve a request now.

Each catalog entry also carries `execution_status`, a live answer to "would a request work right now":

- `ready` — at least one key can actually serve it: enabled, healthy or not yet probed, not scoped away from this model, not on a rate-limit cooldown, and inside its rate and token windows. A key whose `status` is still `unknown` counts as ready, because probing is lazy and a fresh key is usable until something says otherwise.
- `needsKey` — the model is disabled, or no enabled key matches it at all.
- `exhausted` — keys match the model but every one of them is blocked at this moment, so a request would fail immediately. This is the state a burst of 429s produces, and it clears on its own when the cooldowns expire.

`?execution_status=ready` (also `needsKey`, `exhausted`; matched case-insensitively) narrows the catalog rows to one status, so an agent can ask for models it can call without reading the whole list. An unrecognised value filters nothing. Like `?available=`, the filter applies only to catalog rows: `auto`, `fusion` and the `auto:<profile>` chains are router entries rather than models with keys of their own, and are always listed.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/v1/models?execution_status=ready" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer freellmapi-your-unified-key"
```

## Streaming

```python
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Stream me a haiku about SQLite."}],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)
```

## Tool calling

Pass OpenAI-style `tools` and `tool_choice`; the assistant response round-trips back through the proxy exactly like the OpenAI API. Multi-step flows (assistant `tool_calls` → `tool` role follow-up → final answer) work across every provider the router can reach.

```python
tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current weather for a city.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},
            "required": ["city"],
        },
    },
}]

# 1. Model asks for a tool call
first = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Karachi?"}],
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice="required",
)
call = first.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]

# 2. You execute the tool, feed the result back
final = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Karachi?"},
        first.choices[0].message,
        {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": call.id, "content": '{"temp_c": 32, "cond": "sunny"}'},
    ],
    tools=tools,
)
print(final.choices[0].message.content)
```

Works with `stream=True` as well — you'll get `delta.tool_calls` chunks followed by a `finish_reason: "tool_calls"` close. Under the hood, OpenAI-compatible providers (Groq, Cerebras, Mistral, OpenRouter, GitHub Models, HuggingFace, Cloudflare, Cohere compat) get the request passed through; Gemini requests get translated into Google's `functionDeclarations` / `functionResponse` shape and the response is translated back.

## Gemini Google Search grounding

Google's models can ground their answers in live Google Search results. Since the OpenAI wire format has no way to express that, request a tool named `google_search` and the Google provider translates it into Gemini's native grounding tool. It can be sent on its own or alongside your normal function tools.

```python
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",  # pin a Google model so the request routes there
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Who won the F1 race this weekend?"}],
    tools=[{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "google_search", "parameters": {}}}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Native Gemini API

Gemini SDKs and Gemini CLI can use the native `/v1beta` surface:

- `GET /v1beta/models`
- `GET /v1beta/models/{model}`
- `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent`
- `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent` (`?alt=sse` for Gemini CLI)
- `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:countTokens`

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent" \
  -H "x-goog-api-key: freellmapi-your-unified-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"contents":[{"role":"user","parts":[{"text":"hello"}]}]}'
```

Gemini model names like `gemini-2.5-flash` resolve through the Gemini family map (Keys → Gemini model mapping) rather than the catalog directly, so they route to Auto or whichever catalog model each family is pinned to. Catalog ids work verbatim too.

`contents` text, inline data, function calls/responses, system instructions,
function declarations, structured JSON output, generation controls, and
thinking budgets translate into the same internal chat/fallback pipeline.
Bearer auth works too. Gemini's `?key=` query parameter is accepted only below
`/v1beta`; prefer a header because URL credentials leak into history and logs.

## Ollama emulation

The opt-in Ollama surface implements tags, chat, generate, show, version, embed,
and legacy embeddings under `/api/*`. Streaming is Ollama-compatible NDJSON.
It defaults to `off`; choose `open-loopback` or `key-required` on
**Keys → Agents**. Open-loopback checks the direct socket peer, so desktop LAN
access cannot silently turn it into an unauthenticated LAN endpoint.

The dashboard also owns `/api/embeddings`. A request with a valid dashboard
session continues to the dashboard handler; all other requests at that exact
path are treated as Ollama legacy embeddings and follow the emulation policy.

## Revocable URL tokens

Headerless clients can mirror models, chat completions, Responses, and
Ollama-style chat/tags under `/v1/t/{token}/…`. These tokens are random,
stored only as hashes, separately revocable, and are not the unified key.
Create/revoke them on **Keys → Agents**.

Treat them as sensitive anyway: URLs are routinely retained by shell history,
reverse proxies, browser history, and telemetry. Revocation is immediate.

## Vision / image input

Send images with the standard OpenAI `image_url` content blocks (base64 `data:` URLs or `http(s)` URLs). When a request contains an image, the router restricts itself to **vision-capable models** and ignores text-only ones. Vision models are tagged with a **Vision** badge on the Fallback Chain page; the current set includes Gemini (2.5 / 3.x), Llama 4 Scout/Maverick (Groq, NVIDIA), GLM-4.6V Flash (Z.ai), Nemotron Nano 12B VL (OpenRouter), and GitHub's GPT-4o / GPT-4.1.

```python
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto",  # auto-routes to a vision model
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/png;base64,<...>"}},
        ],
    }],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

If no vision-capable model is enabled in your Fallback Chain, an image request returns a clear `422` (`code: "no_vision_model"`) rather than silently dropping the image. (Image input on `/v1/responses` isn't supported yet — use `/v1/chat/completions`.)

## Document attachments

Anthropic's `document` content blocks are accepted on `/v1/messages` when their source is already text:

```json
{"type": "document", "title": "contract.txt",
 "source": {"type": "text", "media_type": "text/plain", "data": "PAYMENT TERMS: net 30."}}
```

`text` and `content` sources are inlined into the prompt, wrapped in a fence tagged with a hash of the document body so the model can tell quoted material from your instructions. The tag is derived from the content rather than randomized, so a repeated attachment keeps the prompt prefix stable and stays cacheable.

**Binary sources — `base64` (PDF, DOCX, XLSX…) and `url` — return a `400`.** No provider in the pool accepts them, and there is no local converter, so the honest answer is to refuse: forwarding the request would drop the attachment and produce a confident answer about a document the model never saw. The rejection happens before routing, so it spends no provider quota. Send the extracted text instead.

`url` sources are refused rather than fetched on your behalf; making the proxy retrieve arbitrary URLs would turn it into a request forwarder for whatever a client names.

## Images, video & text-to-speech

`POST /v1/images/generations`, `POST /v1/videos/generations`, and `POST /v1/audio/speech` route across the providers that serve media models. Images and speech also accept custom OpenAI-compatible media endpoints; video does not. Browse and toggle them on the dashboard's **Models → Image / Video / Audio** tabs.

Video generation is served by two platforms — **`pollinations`** and **`huggingface`** (`VIDEO_PLATFORMS`). It accepts a JSON body with `prompt`, optional `model` (`auto` by default), and provider-dependent `duration`, `aspect_ratio`, `image`, `seed`, and `audio` options. A video job runs for minutes, so the whole surface is **bounded to a 5-minute timeout** (`VIDEO_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`); if the provider hasn't finished by then the request returns `504`. A client that hangs up mid-generation is detected via the socket `close` event, which aborts the work so the gateway does not keep polling (and fail over to a second provider) for a response nobody is waiting for.

HuggingFace models route through the **fal queue** (`router.huggingface.co/fal-ai/…`): the request is submitted as a queued job, polled every 500 ms until `COMPLETED`, and the resulting video URL is fetched and streamed back. Pollinations models are requested directly. Both return the generated video as binary MP4 data with `X-Provider` and `X-Model` response headers:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/v1/videos/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer freellmapi-your-unified-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"auto","prompt":"a sunrise over a quiet lake","duration":6}' \
  --output video.mp4
```

## Fusion (multi-model synthesis)

Request the virtual `fusion` model and the router fans your prompt out to a panel of diverse free models in parallel, then a judge model synthesizes one answer from the drafts. Panel, judge, and strategy are configurable on the dashboard's **Fusion** page or per request via the `fusion` field; each sub-call goes through normal routing, quotas, and analytics.

## Response headers

Every response carries an `X-Routed-Via: <platform>/<model>` header so you can see which provider actually served each call. If a request fell over between providers, you'll also see `X-Fallback-Attempts: N` and `X-Fallback-Trail`, which names each hop that failed and why:

```
X-Fallback-Attempts: 2
X-Fallback-Trail: groq/llama-3.3-70b key1=rate_limited; google/gemini-2.5-flash key2=timeout
```

`X-Fallback-Detail` adds what each of those hops **cost**, which is the part you cannot reconstruct from the trail — a request answered in 40s reads identically whether one provider stalled for 39 seconds or four failed fast:

```
X-Fallback-Detail: groq/llama-3.3-70b key1=rate_limited t=0+39000ms msg=Groq API error 429: rate limit; google/gemini-2.5-flash key2=timeout t=39000+12ms
```

`t=<start>+<duration>ms` is the offset from the start of the failover chain and how long that hop ran. `msg=` is the provider's error, redacted and truncated; it is last in each record, and any semicolon inside it becomes a comma so `; ` stays an unambiguous record separator.

The detail header is **off by default** — it puts hop timings and provider error text on the response. Turn it on with `FALLBACK_DETAIL_HEADER=1` or the `expose_fallback_detail_header` settings key, which takes precedence. Both headers list at most ten hops and then a `; +N more` marker.

Only hops that already **failed** can appear. The hop actually serving your request is recorded after its response finishes — after the JSON is sent, or after the stream closes — so its duration does not exist while the headers are still open. Use `X-Routed-Via` to see which provider that was.

HTTP headers only carry printable ASCII, so a model id with characters outside that range (a Chinese name from a relay catalog, for example) is percent-encoded in the header — run the value through `decodeURIComponent` (or `urllib.parse.unquote`) to read it back.

The opt-in response cache can be toggled per request with `X-FreeLLM-Cache: on|off` — an exact-match in-memory LRU for identical requests, streaming included (a streamed hit replays the stored SSE verbatim) (canonical SHA-256 keys over the full request, TTL and temperature gates, saved-token stats on the dashboard). Off by default; cache hits consume zero provider quota.

When [prompt compression](../compression/01-compression-pipeline.md) is enabled, `X-FreeLLM-Compress: off|on|lossless|standard|aggressive` can disable or lower the configured mode for one request. It cannot raise the operator's configured mode. The response reports the effective mode and estimated savings, for example `X-FreeLLM-Compress: standard; saved~=1840`.

`X-FreeLLM-Task-Type: code|chat|auto` tells the router what kind of turn this is, so it can bias the routing weights: `code` trades some of the speed weight for intelligence (a wrong answer costs more than a slow one), `chat` does the reverse. It is a soft preference only — capability gates, the failover chain and the model catalog are untouched, and the shift is 30% of one axis by default. The default is `auto`: tool-bearing requests and messages carrying unambiguous code markers (a fenced block, a declaration, a stack frame, a `file.ts:214` reference) are treated as `code`, and everything else keeps the preset weights exactly as configured. The `fastest`, `reliable` and `custom` routing strategies ignore the header — those are an explicit operator choice about where on the axis to sit.

How far the shift goes is operator-tunable: `GET /api/settings/task-weight-share` reads the current fraction and `PUT /api/settings/task-weight-share` with `{"share": 0..1}` sets it (default `0.3`). `0` disables the bias while leaving the header itself accepted, and `null` clears the setting back to the default. It takes effect on the next request, with no restart.

## Embeddings

`/v1/embeddings` is OpenAI-compatible, with one deliberate difference from chat routing: **failover never crosses models.** Vectors from different models live in incompatible spaces — silently switching models would corrupt any vector store built on top of the proxy. So embeddings route by **family** (one model identity + dimension), and failover only walks the providers serving that same family.

```python
resp = client.embeddings.create(
    model="auto",          # default family; or a family name like "bge-m3"
    input=["the quick brown fox", "pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs"],
)
print(len(resp.data), "vectors of", len(resp.data[0].embedding), "dims")
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer freellmapi-your-unified-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "auto", "input": "hello world"}'
```

`model` accepts `auto` (the configured default family), a family name, or a provider-specific model id (which resolves to its family). Available families:

| Family (`model`) | Dims | Providers (failover order) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gemini-embedding-001` *(default)* | 3072 | Google |
| `text-embedding-3-large` | 3072 | GitHub Models |
| `text-embedding-3-small` | 1536 | GitHub Models |
| `embed-v4.0` | 1536 | Cohere |
| `bge-m3` | 1024 | Cloudflare → Hugging Face |
| `qwen3-embedding-0.6b` | 1024 | Cloudflare |
| `nv-embedqa-e5-v5` | 1024 | NVIDIA |
| `llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2` | 2048 | NVIDIA |
| `llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2` | 2048 | NVIDIA → OpenRouter |
| `embeddinggemma-300m` | 768 | Cloudflare |

The default family, per-provider toggles, and priorities live on the dashboard's **Models → Embeddings** page. Pick your family once and stick with it for a given vector store — that's the whole point of the family model.

## Anthropic / Claude clients

FreeLLMAPI also speaks Anthropic's Messages API, so anything built for Claude — including **Claude Code** and the official Anthropic SDKs — can run against your free pool. Point the client at your server's **origin** (Anthropic clients append `/v1/messages` themselves) and authenticate with your unified key. Both `x-api-key` and `Authorization: Bearer` are accepted.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: freellmapi-your-unified-key" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "max_tokens": 256,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]
  }'
```

Claude model names map to your free pool on the **Keys → Anthropic** tab: each family (`default`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) routes to `auto` (the router picks a free model) or a model you pin. `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` and a content-negotiated `GET /v1/models` (Anthropic shape when `anthropic-version` is sent) are implemented too. Streaming, system prompts, tool use, and image input all translate across the same router as the OpenAI endpoints.

**Claude Code** — point it at your server and start it:

*On macOS / Linux (Bash):*
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=freellmapi-your-unified-key   # NOT ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
claude
```

*On Windows (PowerShell):*
```powershell
$env:ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3001"
$env:ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="freellmapi-your-unified-key"
claude
```

> Use `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (sent as a Bearer token), **not** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — Claude Code treats a set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a conflicting first-party credential and refuses to start.

## Free-tier budget API

`GET /api/free-tier` returns the operator's free-tier budget as a **pool-deduped** monthly overview. Many models on one platform share the same free pool, so summing every model's label would double-count; the endpoint collapses models into quota pools (`inferQuotaPoolKey`) and reports **one documented budget per pool** (the largest `parseBudget` value seen in it), scaled by the number of usable (enabled + healthy/unknown) keys for the platform. Chain-disabled rows still contribute to a pool — they share the same provider allowance — and are only marked, never dropped, so the totals match the dashboard's stacked per-model bar.

```json
{
  "generatedAt": "2026-08-25T12:00:00.000Z",
  "summary": {
    "poolCount": 18,
    "documentedMonthlyTokens": 7400000000,
    "creditsBasedPools": 2,
    "unpublishedPools": 3
  },
  "pools": [
    {
      "poolKey": "google",
      "platform": "google",
      "memberModelIds": ["gemini-3.0-flash", "gemini-2.5-flash"],
      "modelCount": 2,
      "disabledModelCount": 0,
      "keyCount": 1,
      "documentedBudget": 120000000,
      "bestLabel": "~120M",
      "kind": "documented",
      "quota": { "limit": 150000000, "remaining": 98000000, "resetAt": "2026-08-26T00:00:00.000Z", "metric": "tokens", "keyCount": 1 }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `kind` ∈ `documented` (a parseable monthly budget), `credits` (credit-based), or `unpublished` (no public figure).
- `quota` carries live observations (limit / remaining / reset / metric) when the provider reports them; `metric` prefers `tokens` → `credits` → `neurons` → `requests`.
- Mounted behind the dashboard session (`requireAuth`); not the unified `/v1` key.

## Backups API

`GET /api/backups` lists the encrypted database snapshots the gateway has taken (scheduled or manual via `POST /api/backups`). Each backup is an SQL dump with a header carrying its **sha256 key fingerprint** — `restore` refuses a dump written under a different `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (reports `backup: <fingerprint>; server: <fingerprint>`). The on-disk layout is versioned with `DUMP_FORMAT = 1`; a dump of a different format is rejected with `409`.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 14,
      "filename": "freellmapi-20260825-040000-enc.sql",
      "filesize": 2418688,
      "isFull": true,
      "source": "scheduled",
      "createdAt": "2026-08-25T04:00:00.000Z",
      "tables": ["api_keys", "models", "fallback_config", "settings", "..."]
    }
  ],
  "total": 14
}
```

Endpoints (all behind `requireAuth`):

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/backups` | Paginated listing (`?page=&pageSize=`, max 200) |
| `POST` | `/api/backups` | Create now; optional `tables` whitelist (≤ 500 names) |
| `GET` | `/api/backups/:id/download` | Download the encrypted dump |
| `POST` | `/api/backups/:id/restore` | Restore into the live DB (refuses mismatched key / format) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/backups/:id` | Delete one backup |
| `GET` | `/api/backups/tables` | Tables a dump may contain |
| `GET` / `PUT` | `/api/backups/schedule` | Read / write the backup schedule (HH:mm, interval days, path) |

## Monthly provider-key budgets

Authenticated dashboard clients can set `monthlyRequestCap` and `monthlyTokenCap`
through `PATCH /api/keys/:id`. Both are nonnegative integers; `0` means unlimited.
These limits apply to an upstream provider key across chat, embeddings, and
keyed media requests, and reset at 00:00 UTC on the first of each month. They do
not apply separately to downstream client profiles.

Successful request counts and reported tokens are stored in a durable monthly
ledger. Request-log cleanup does not clear this ledger. Existing retained request
history is backfilled during upgrade; usage already pruned before the upgrade
cannot be reconstructed. In-flight requests reserve capacity until completion,
including long-running streams. Failed attempts release their reservation.

Token reservations use routing estimates. Actual provider token usage can differ,
so the final response can take recorded usage above the configured token cap;
further requests are then rejected. This is a usage guard, not an exact billing
limit. Media requests count toward the request cap; the current media adapters
do not report token usage. Reservations coordinate requests within one gateway
process, not across multiple gateway replicas.

When all otherwise eligible keys have exhausted their monthly budget, standard
chat, embeddings, and media routing returns HTTP `429` with a `Retry-After` header
pointing to the next UTC month. OpenAI-compatible endpoints also return
`error.code: "quota_exceeded"`; other protocol adapters preserve their native
error format. Fusion subcalls obey the caps but retain Fusion's aggregate error
