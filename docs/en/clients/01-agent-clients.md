## OpenAI-compatible clients

Any client that can target an OpenAI-compatible base URL can use FreeLLMAPI:

- **LangChain, LlamaIndex, official OpenAI SDKs**: set `base_url` to
  `http://localhost:3001/v1` and use the unified key from the dashboard.
- **Local GPU boxes**: add custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints for Ollama,
  llama.cpp, LM Studio, vLLM, or an internal gateway.

## Coding agents

Use the generator instead of hand-editing a client configuration:

```bash
export FREELLMAPI_API_KEY=<unified-key>   # or pass --api-key on each command
npx freellmapi setup-claude --url http://localhost:3001 --dry-run
npx freellmapi setup-claude --url http://localhost:3001
npx freellmapi setup-dsh --url http://localhost:3001 --api-key <unified-key>
```

`--dry-run` prints a diff. Real writes merge with the existing configuration
and create a timestamped backup first. `--profile <name>` creates a named
Claude/Codex profile. The live `/v1/models` catalog supplies the model ids and
context windows.

| **Anything else** | `setup-generic` prints a ready block | `http://localhost:3001/v1` | OpenAI Chat |

The root-vs-`/v1` distinction matters: Claude Code expects the server root
because it appends the Anthropic Messages path. OpenAI-compatible clients in
this table—including Cline, Aider, Goose, Codex, Continue, OpenCode, Qwen,
Roo, Kilo, Crush, MiMo Code, AtomCode, OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, QwenPaw, and DeepSeek Harness—expect their configured
base URL to include `/v1`.

### DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`)

[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) keeps
every provider as a route under `llm-pi-ai.providers` in
`$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml` (`~/.dsh` by default). `setup-dsh` adds a
`freellmapi` route there — `api: openai-completions`, the gateway's `/v1`
base URL, and the live catalog as the route's `models` list, which DSH
requires for a provider its installed catalog does not ship — and makes
`freellmapi/auto` the default model. The key goes into `$DSH_HOME/.env`
(mode 0600) as `FREELLMAPI_API_KEY`, the environment layer DSH reads on its
own, so nothing needs exporting. Both writes are structural merges: other
routes, comments, and settings in the file are left as they were.

```bash
npx freellmapi setup-dsh --url http://localhost:3001 --api-key <unified-key>
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

Settings are hot-reloaded, so a running `dsh` uses the route on its next
request. `--profile <name>` adds a second route (`freellmapi-<name>`) without
changing the default model; `--model <id>` pins the default. Routes are
declared text-only — add `input: [text, image]` to a model entry under
`freellmapi.models` to send it images. `DSH_HOME` is honoured when set.

### MiMo Code (`mimo`)

[MiMo Code](https://mimo.xiaomi.com/mimocode) is an OpenCode derivative, so it
takes any OpenAI-compatible endpoint as a custom entry under `provider` — an
`npm` package to speak with (`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`), the credentials in
`options`, and a `models` map. `setup-mimo` writes that entry as `freellmapi`
and names `freellmapi/<model>` as the default `model`.

The file is `config.json` in MiMo's own global config directory:
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mimocode` (`~/.config/mimocode` on macOS and Linux), or
`$MIMOCODE_HOME/config` when `MIMOCODE_HOME` is set. That directory merges
`config.json`, `mimocode.json` and `mimocode.jsonc` in that order, so the
generated file is the weakest layer and anything you hand-write in
`mimocode.json` still wins. The write itself is a structural merge, so other
providers and settings already in `config.json` are left as they were.

```bash
npx freellmapi setup-mimo --url http://localhost:3001
export FREELLMAPI_API_KEY=<unified-key>
mimo
```

The key is referenced as `{env:FREELLMAPI_API_KEY}`, MiMo's own substitution
syntax, so it stays out of the config file. There is no `MIMOCODE_API_KEY` or
`MIMOCODE_BASE_URL`: MiMo's environment variables locate resources and toggle
features, they are not a general fallback for config fields. Each model is
declared with the `limit.context` and `limit.output` pair MiMo's schema
requires, both taken from the live catalog.

### AtomCode (`atomcode`)

[AtomCode](https://atomcode.atomgit.com/docs/en/) is AtomGit's terminal
coding agent, written in Rust. It reads `~/.atomcode/config.toml`, where a
root `default_provider` key names one `[providers.<id>]` table and
`type = "openai"` makes that table speak the OpenAI-compatible wire.
`setup-atomcode` writes a `[providers.freellmapi]` table — `base_url` on the
gateway's `/v1`, the unified key as `api_key`, the chosen model and its
`context_window` from the live catalog — and sets `default_provider` to it.
The write is a structural merge: the root key is placed above any existing
tables, only the `freellmapi` table is replaced, and other `[providers.*]`
tables and settings in the file are left as they were.

```bash
npx freellmapi setup-atomcode --url http://localhost:3001 --api-key <unified-key>
atomcode
```

AtomCode has no environment-variable fallback for the key, so it is written
into the config file; the file is created with mode 0600 and a timestamped
backup is taken before an existing one is changed. `--model <id>` pins the
default model.

### OpenClaw

[OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/) is the always-on personal assistant
that answers on WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord and the other channels its
gateway connects to. It reads one JSON5 document, `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`,
and every model endpoint is an entry under `models.providers`; a provider its
bundled catalog does not know must spell out `baseUrl`, `api` and a non-empty
`models` list. `setup-openclaw` writes a `freellmapi` provider there —
`api: openai-completions`, the gateway's `/v1` base URL, the live catalog as
its `models` list — and makes `freellmapi/auto` the default model under
`agents.defaults.model.primary`. The key is referenced as
`${FREELLMAPI_API_KEY}`, OpenClaw's own substitution, and the value goes into
`~/.openclaw/.env` (mode 0600), the global env file OpenClaw loads on its own,
so nothing needs exporting. Both writes are structural merges: other
providers, `fallbacks` on the default model, and every other setting in the
file are left as they were.

```bash
npx freellmapi setup-openclaw --url http://localhost:3001 --api-key <unified-key>
npm install -g openclaw@latest --allow-scripts=openclaw
openclaw agent exec --model freellmapi/auto "Say hello"   # no gateway daemon needed
```

A running `openclaw gateway` needs a restart to pick the change up.
`--profile <name>` adds a second provider (`freellmapi-<name>`) without
changing the default model; `--model <id>` pins the default. OpenClaw sends a
bare SDK user agent to custom endpoints, so the provider carries a static
`User-Agent: openclaw` header — that is what lights the "seen recently" badge
on the Agents page. Models are declared text-only; add `input: ["text",
"image"]` to a model entry under `models.providers.freellmapi.models` to send
it images. `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`, `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` and `OPENCLAW_HOME` are
honoured when set.

### Hermes Agent (`hermes`)

[Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/) is Nous
Research's self-improving agent, in the terminal or behind Telegram, Discord
and the other messengers its gateway serves. `~/.hermes/config.yaml` is its
single source of truth for the endpoint: `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is ignored for
anything but api.openai.com and `OPENAI_API_KEY` is only sent to OpenAI hosts,
so a custom endpoint has to be declared in the `model` block. `setup-hermes`
writes that block — `provider: custom`, `api_mode: chat_completions`, the
gateway's `/v1` as `base_url`, the chosen model as `default` with its
`context_length` from the live catalog — and references the key as
`api_key: "${FREELLMAPI_API_KEY}"`, Hermes's own substitution, with the value
in `~/.hermes/.env` (mode 0600), which Hermes loads on its own. A fresh
install ships `model: ""`, the "not configured" sentinel; replacing it is
exactly what `hermes setup` would do, and it is what lets a headless first
run skip the wizard. Every other key in the file is left as it was.

```bash
npx freellmapi setup-hermes --url http://localhost:3001 --api-key <unified-key>
curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash -s -- --skip-setup
hermes -z "Say hello"
```

A running `hermes gateway` needs a restart to pick the change up.
`--profile <name>` adds a `providers.freellmapi-<name>` entry instead —
picked inside a chat with `/model custom:freellmapi-<name>:auto` — and leaves
the default model alone; `--model <id>` pins the default. Hermes sends a bare
SDK user agent to custom endpoints, so the block carries
`default_headers: { User-Agent: hermes-agent }`, which is what the Agents
page's "seen recently" badge keys on. `HERMES_HOME` is honoured when set.

### QwenPaw

[QwenPaw](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw) supports custom providers
that use the OpenAI `chat.completions` API. Start FreeLLMAPI, create or copy a
unified key from its dashboard, then open **Settings → Models** in the QwenPaw
Console:

1. Under **Providers**, choose **Add Provider**.
2. Give it a **Provider ID** such as `freellmapi` and a **Provider Name** such
   as `FreeLLMAPI`, and set the API compatibility mode to OpenAI
   `chat.completions`.
3. Open the new provider's settings and set **Base URL** to
   `http://localhost:3001/v1` and **API Key** to your FreeLLMAPI unified key.
4. On the provider's models page, add a model. Use `auto` as the **Model ID**
   to let FreeLLMAPI route the request, or copy a current id from
   `GET http://localhost:3001/v1/models`.
5. Save, then pick the model as the default (or per chat) and send a test
   message.

If QwenPaw runs in a container, `localhost` refers to that container rather
than the host running FreeLLMAPI. Use a hostname or host-gateway address that
the QwenPaw container can reach, while keeping the `/v1` suffix. Do not put the
unified key in a URL, screenshot, or issue report. See QwenPaw's
[official model configuration guide](https://qwenpaw.agentscope.io/docs/models)
for the current Console field names.

## Native Gemini clients

Gemini CLI and Gemini-lineage clients can speak Google's wire format directly:

```bash
export GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
export GEMINI_API_KEY=freellmapi-your-unified-key
gemini
```

The native surface implements `GET /v1beta/models`, model metadata,
`generateContent`, `streamGenerateContent` (including `?alt=sse`), and
`countTokens`. Authentication accepts `x-goog-api-key`, Bearer, or Gemini's
`?key=` fallback. Prefer the header: query credentials leak into history and
proxy logs.

The **Keys → Agents** tab maps Gemini Pro, Flash, and Flash-Lite family names to
Auto or a pinned catalog model.

## Ollama clients

Ollama emulation is off by default. Enable one of these modes on
**Keys → Agents**:

- `open-loopback`: no key on this machine only. The socket peer must be
  `127.0.0.1`/`::1`; enabling desktop LAN access does not widen it.
  **Docker note:** inside a container the socket peer is the Docker bridge
  IP, not loopback, so this mode refuses even host-local traffic through a
  published port — use `key-required` for Docker deployments.
- `key-required`: clients must send `Authorization: Bearer <unified-key>`.

The exact endpoints are `/api/tags`, `/api/chat`, `/api/generate`, `/api/show`,
`/api/version`, `/api/embed`, and legacy `/api/embeddings`. Streaming uses
newline-delimited JSON, not SSE. Point Zed, JetBrains AI Assistant, or another
Ollama-capable client at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Headerless clients

If a client cannot set headers, create a separately revocable token on
**Keys → Agents** and use:

```text
http://localhost:3001/v1/t/<token>/chat/completions
http://localhost:3001/v1/t/<token>/responses
http://localhost:3001/v1/t/<token>/models
```

The same prefix exposes `/api/chat` and `/api/tags`. Never put the unified API
key in a URL. URL tokens have independent hashes and immediate revocation
because URLs routinely leak into shell history, reverse-proxy logs, and
telemetry.

## MCP server

On top of inference, the router is an **MCP server**: agents can introspect it mid-session
(usable models and the params each one honors, provider health, usage and cache stats,
routing strategy).

The MCP surface is a setting rather than an always-on endpoint (#925). **Fresh installs
start with it off**; installs that already had provider keys configured when they upgraded
keep it on, so an existing Claude Code or Cline session does not break on upgrade. Toggle
it on the Keys page under **Agent compatibility**, or from the API:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/settings/enable-mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <dashboard-token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": true}'
```

While it is off, every verb on `/mcp` answers `403` with a JSON-RPC error saying so.

For Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http freellmapi http://localhost:3001/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer freellmapi-your-unified-key"
```

Any MCP client that speaks Streamable HTTP works the same way: point it at `/mcp` with the
unified key as a Bearer token.

FreeLLMAPI is local-first and single-user by design. Your provider keys stay in
your SQLite database, encrypted at rest, and requests go from your machine to the
upstream providers you enabled.

## VS Code ghost-text autocomplete (Continue)

FreeLLMAPI exposes `/v1/completions` for editor autocomplete clients that send legacy OpenAI prompt/suffix requests. Example Continue config:

```yaml
models:
  - name: FreeLLMAPI Autocomplete
    provider: openai
    model: auto
    apiBase: http://localhost:3001/v1
    apiKey: freellmapi-your-unified-key
    useLegacyCompletionsEndpoint: true
    roles:
      - autocomplete
```

## Context Handoff

When FreeLLMAPI falls over to a different model mid-conversation (quota, rate limit, cooldown), the new model has no idea it is picking up someone else's task. **Context handoff** adds a single compact `system` message to the outbound request that tells the new model exactly that:

```
FreeLLMAPI context handoff:
You are taking over an ongoing conversation from another model (groq:llama-3 → google:gemini-flash).
Continue the user's task using the conversation context already provided in this request.
Do not restart the task, re-ask already answered setup questions, or discard prior tool results.
Respect the user's latest message as the highest-priority instruction.

Recent session summary:
User: …
Assistant: …
```

**Enable it in `.env`:**

```env
FREELLMAPI_CONTEXT_HANDOFF=on_model_switch
```

**How it works:**

- Messages per session are stored in memory (TTL: 3 hours).
- Only injected when the selected model changes for a given session key.
- Not injected on the first request, on same-model continuations, or if a handoff message is already present.
- Session key: `X-Session-Id` header if present, otherwise SHA-1 of the first user message (same as sticky sessions).
- Storage is in-memory only. Nothing is written to disk or logged.

> **Important:** Context Handoff improves continuity for conversations routed through FreeLLMAPI. It cannot recover provider-internal hidden state or messages that were never sent to the proxy.
