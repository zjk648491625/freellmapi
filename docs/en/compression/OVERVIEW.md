# Compression Domain

## Scope

This domain covers the prompt and context compression pipeline that reduces request
size before cache lookup, token budgeting, and routing. It documents the
compression modes (lossless, standard, aggressive), the individual engines,
preservation guarantees and fidelity gates, per-request controls, custom
tool-output filters, and the statistics/preview APIs.

## File index

| File | Description |
