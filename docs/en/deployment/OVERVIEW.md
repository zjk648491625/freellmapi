# Deployment overview

## Scope

Operating FreeLLMAPI in Docker: the published image, Compose quickstart, persistence, healthchecks, the container-networking gotchas, and the ongoing maintenance work — upgrading, backups, and declarative configuration. Content is derived from [`Dockerfile`](../../../Dockerfile), [`docker-compose.yml`](../../../docker-compose.yml), [`.dockerignore`](../../../.dockerignore), and [docs/en/install/01-install.md](../install/01-install.md).

For installation paths beyond Docker (one-liner script, local development, desktop app), see [Install & deploy](../install/01-install.md).

## File index

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [01-docker.md](01-docker.md) | The image (multi-stage build on `node:20-bookworm-slim`), Compose quickstart, ports and LAN access, volumes and persistence, healthcheck, non-root runtime, native `better-sqlite3` compile rationale, and why a container cannot reach providers the host can (#733). |
| [02-updates-and-backup.md](02-updates-and-backup.md) | Upgrade flow (`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`), the dashboard update checker (#635/#703), backing up the SQLite data volume, and declarative config/catalog controls (#f4cd7b4). |
