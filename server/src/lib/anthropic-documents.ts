/**
 * Anthropic `document` content blocks on a surface whose providers are all
 * text-and-image only.
 *
 * Today such a block passes the permissive envelope schema and is then dropped
 * with every other unrecognised type, so a client that attaches a PDF gets a
 * confident answer about a document the model never saw. That is the worst of
 * the available behaviours: worse than refusing, because nothing tells the
 * caller their attachment went nowhere.
 *
 * Anthropic defines four source kinds, and they split cleanly:
 *
 *   text, content  — the document IS text already. Converting it costs nothing
 *                    and needs nothing installed, so we do it.
 *   base64, url    — the bytes need a real converter (PDF, DOCX, XLSX…). No
 *                    provider in the pool accepts them and nothing here can
 *                    decode them, so these are refused with an actionable
 *                    message instead of being silently discarded.
 *
 * Stringifying the block instead — which is what a naive passthrough does —
 * would inject an entire base64 payload into the prompt. That is not a cheaper
 * version of support; it is a way to burn a context window on nothing.
