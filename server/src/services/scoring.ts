// ── Bandit routing score ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A redesign of the analytics-driven router. Instead of summing a pile of
// hand-tuned, dimensionally-incompatible bonuses (a probability + a raw latency
// term + an intelligence term, each hand-capped to keep orderings sane), every
// signal here is normalized to [0, 1] and combined as a CONVEX COMBINATION:
//
//   base = w_rel·reliability + w_speed·speed + w_intel·intelligence
//          (weights are a preset that sums to 1, so base ∈ [0, 1])
//
// Two always-on GUARDRAILS then multiply the base — they never reorder good
// models against each other, they only pull a model down as it gets dangerous:
//
//   effective = base × headroomFactor × rateLimitFactor
//
//   headroomFactor  → protects a model that is nearly out of its free quota
//   rateLimitFactor → demotes a model that is currently throwing 429s
//
// Reliability is drawn from a Beta posterior (Thompson sampling) so exploration
// is automatic and proportional to uncertainty — a model is never permanently
// frozen out after a couple of failures. Speed and intelligence are
// deterministic. The result stays in a bounded, interpretable range and no term
// needs a manual cap to "still beat a 0%-success model".
